# CMSC140_Python

GAME OVERVIEW:

In this user friendly wordle game, the objective is to try and guess the five letter word in a specified number of chances. 
To play, simply run the code in whatever counsol you prefer to code with python, then follow the user prompts. Any mistake along the way will be caught by the program, so don't worry if you accidently screw up. 
The levels include Easy, Medium, and Hard, and you will get the option to play again once your game has expired. Feel free to play as many times as you like! To end the game, simply respond with any valid form of No to the final prompt!

OUTSIDE TOOLS:

This game was made using the following python packages: 
1. re (Used for Regex matching)
2. random (Used for choosing random 5 letter words)

The list of plausible 5 letter words was produced by Lawrence University Computer Science Professor 
, and the complete file is available under the wordle.txt document. (Note this is a text file!)

AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS:

Game Produced Fall, 2022 for CMSC 140 Intro to Python Programming

The authors of this program are Adam Bruce and Lilia Bodnar of Lawrence University

Adam was responsible for producing the user inputs/print statement designs and regex lists. Primarily, work was done collaboratively, which included producing viable for and while loops, using functions within functions structures, creating lists for storing inputs, and if/else statements. Of course, much more work was done collectively, but these are some of the highlights found in the game!
